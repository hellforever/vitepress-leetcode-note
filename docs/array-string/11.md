# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

You are given an integer array <code>height</code> of length <code>n</code>. There are <code>n</code> vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the <code>i^th</code> line are <code>(i, 0)</code> and <code>(i, height[i])</code>.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice**  that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 287px;">

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>n == height.length</code>
- <code>2 <= n <= 10^5</code>
- <code>0 <= height[i] <= 10^4</code>

## Approach: Two Pointers (Greedy)

We use two pointers `left` and `right`, starting from the beginning and end of the array. At each step, we calculate the area between these two lines:

```
area = (right - left) × min(height[left], height[right])
```

he height of the container is determined by the **shorter** of the two lines, and the width is the distance between the two indices.

To potentially increase the area:
- We move the pointer pointing to the **shorter line**, because moving the longer line can never increase the height, and the width always decreases.

We repeat this process while `left < right` and keep track of the maximum area found.


## ✅ Kotlin Code

```kotlin
fun maxArea(height: IntArray): Int {
    var left = 0
    var right = height.lastIndex
    var maxArea = 0

    while (left < right) {
        val h = minOf(height[left], height[right])
        val w = right - left
        val area = h * w
        maxArea = maxOf(maxArea, area)

        // Move the shorter line inward
        if (height[left] < height[right]) {
            left++
        } else {
            right--
        }
    }

    return maxArea
}
```

### ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
  We scan the array once using two pointers, moving them toward each other.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
  Only a few integer variables are used; no extra space is required proportional to input size.
