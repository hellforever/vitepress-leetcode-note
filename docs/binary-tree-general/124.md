# [124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<Badge type="danger" text="Hard" />

A **path**  in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once** . Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum**  of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the <code>root</code> of a binary tree, return the maximum **path sum**  of any **non-empty**  path.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx1.jpg" style="width: 322px; height: 182px;">

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg">

```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[1, 3 * 10^4]</code>.
- <code>-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000</code>

## üí° Approach

Use **post-order traversal** (left ‚ûù right ‚ûù root) combined with **recursive backtracking**.  
At each node:

1. Calculate the maximum contribution from the left subtree `leftGain` (use 0 if it‚Äôs negative).
2. Calculate the maximum contribution from the right subtree `rightGain` (use 0 if it‚Äôs negative).
3. The maximum path sum with the current node as the highest point is:  `val + leftGain + rightGain` Update the **global maximum** if this is higher.
4. To continue the path upward, return: `val + max(leftGain, rightGain)` since the path cannot split upward (it must go through only one child).

## ‚úÖ Kotlin Code

```kotlin
class TreeNode(var `val`: Int) {
 var left: TreeNode? = null
 var right: TreeNode? = null
}

class Solution {
 private var maxSum = Int.MIN_VALUE

 fun maxPathSum(root: TreeNode?): Int {
     maxGain(root)
     return maxSum
 }

 private fun maxGain(node: TreeNode?): Int {
     if (node == null) return 0

     val leftGain = maxOf(maxGain(node.left), 0)
     val rightGain = maxOf(maxGain(node.right), 0)

     val currentMax = node.`val` + leftGain + rightGain
     maxSum = maxOf(maxSum, currentMax)

     return node.`val` + maxOf(leftGain, rightGain)
 }
}
```

## Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack).
