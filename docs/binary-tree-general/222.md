# [222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)<Badge type="warning" text="Easy" />

Given the <code>root</code> of a **complete**  binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to **<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>** , every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between <code>1</code> and <code>2^h</code> nodes inclusive at the last level <code>h</code>.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than<code data-stringify-type="code">O(n)</code>time complexity.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/14/complete.jpg" style="width: 372px; height: 302px;">

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:** 

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range <code>[0, 5 * 10^4]</code>.
- <code>0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4</code>
- The tree is guaranteed to be **complete** .

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

Use the properties of a **complete binary tree** to optimize the counting process.

At each node:

1. Compute the height of the left subtree (`leftHeight`) and the right subtree (`rightHeight`).
2. If both heights are equal:
   - The left subtree is a **perfect binary tree** with `2^leftHeight - 1` nodes.
   - So total nodes = `(1 << leftHeight) + countNodes(right)`
3. If the heights are not equal:
   - The right subtree is a **perfect binary tree** with `2^rightHeight - 1` nodes.
   - So total nodes = `(1 << rightHeight) + countNodes(left)`
4. Recursively apply this logic to the non-perfect subtree.

This method avoids traversing every node and runs in **logÂ² n** time.

## âœ… Kotlin Code

```kotlin
class TreeNode(var `val`: Int) {
    var left: TreeNode? = null
    var right: TreeNode? = null
}

class Solution {
    fun countNodes(root: TreeNode?): Int {
        if (root == null) return 0

        val leftHeight = getHeight(root.left)
        val rightHeight = getHeight(root.right)

        return if (leftHeight == rightHeight) {
            (1 shl leftHeight) + countNodes(root.right)
        } else {
            (1 shl rightHeight) + countNodes(root.left)
        }
    }

    private fun getHeight(node: TreeNode?): Int {
        var height = 0
        var current = node
        while (current != null) {
            height++
            current = current.left
        }
        return height
    }
}
```

## Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(logÂ² n)

- Each recursive call does O(log n) work to compute height.

- There are O(log n) levels of recursion in the worst case.

**Space Complexity:** O(log n)

- Due to recursion stack (tree height in a complete binary tree).
