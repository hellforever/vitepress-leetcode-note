# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree <Badge type="warning" text="Medium" />

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

>Example 1:   
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

>Example 2:  
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

>Example 3:  
Input：root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2   
Output：1


## 💡 Approach

Use **post-order traversal** (left ➝ right ➝ root).  
At each node:

1. If the current node is `null`, return `null`.
2. If the current node is `p` or `q`, return the current node.
3. Recursively search in the left and right subtrees.
4. If both left and right return non-null, current node is the LCA.
5. Otherwise, return the non-null one (left or right).

## ✅ Kotlin Code

```kotlin
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode(var `val`: Int = 0) {
 *     var left: TreeNode? = null
 *     var right: TreeNode? = null
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    fun lowestCommonAncestor(root: TreeNode?, p: TreeNode?, q: TreeNode?): TreeNode? {
        if (root == null || root == p || root == q) return root

        val left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        val right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

        return when {
            left != null && right != null -> root
            left != null -> left
            else -> right
        }
    }
}
```

## Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (recursion stack)
