# [309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/description/)

You are given an array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the price of a given stock on the <code>i^th</code> day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

**Note:**  You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:** 

- <code>1 <= prices.length <= 5000</code>
- <code>0 <= prices[i] <= 1000</code>

## Approach: Dynamic Programming (DP Table)

We define three states for each day `i`:
| State                | Meaning                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `dp[i][0]`           | Maximum profit on day `i`, **holding** a stock |
| `dp[i][1]`           | Maximum profit on day `i`, **just sold** (cooldown) |
| `dp[i][2]`           | Maximum profit on day `i`, **resting without stock** |

On each day, we update these three states based on previous states.

## State Transitions

###  Holding a stock
We can either:
- Keep holding the stock from yesterday: `dp[i-1][0]`
- Buy today (must have been resting yesterday): `dp[i-1][2] - prices[i]`

```text
dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2] - prices[i])
```

### Just Sold (Cooldown)

Only possible by selling today:

```text
dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] + prices[i]
// held yesterday → sell today
```


### Resting (No Stock & Not Cooldown)

Two ways to rest:
- Continue resting from yesterday.
- Finish cooldown from yesterday’s sell.

```text
dp[i][2] = max( dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2] )
// cooldown finished or kept resting
```

### Base Case

On day 0:

```text
dp[0][0] = -prices[0] // bought stock
dp[0][1] = 0      // cannot sell yet
dp[0][2] = 0      // resting
```


### Final Answer

On the last day, you cannot end while holding stock.
Answer is:

```text
max( dp[n-1][1], dp[n-1][2] )
```


## ✅ Kotlin Solution
```kotlin
class Solution {
    fun maxProfit(prices: IntArray): Int {
        val n = prices.size
        if (n == 0) return 0

        val dp = Array(n) { IntArray(3) }

        // Base case
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0]
        dp[0][1] = 0
        dp[0][2] = 0

        for (i in 1 until n) {
            // Holding stock
            dp[i][0] = maxOf(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][2] - prices[i])

            // Just sold (cooldown)
            dp[i][1] = dp[i-1][0] + prices[i]

            // Resting
            dp[i][2] = maxOf(dp[i-1][1], dp[i-1][2])
        }

        return maxOf(dp[n-1][1], dp[n-1][2])
    }
}
```

## Complexity

| Metric   | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Time** | O(n) — we iterate over the `prices` array once, updating three states each day |
| **Space** | O(n) — for the `dp` table. (Can be optimized to O(1) since each day only depends on the previous day) |
